<p>Through this project, I would like to gain more experience on team based projects.</p>

<p>All of the programming projects I've done so far have been solo projects, so I’m excited to see the process of creating a practical application as a team. I would like to improve my knowledge on meteor and react by learning through my group members or online.</p>

<p>My background is from prior ICS classes at UH Manoa. I’d say my greatest skill is that I can spend long periods of time on something until I finish. It’s not really a skill, but I will spend as many hours needed to complete a project.</p>

<div style="background-color:#F4F7F9; border-left: 2px solid cornflowerblue; padding: 1px 10px;">

<p>I would like to learn more about Meteor, React, Bootstrap, and SimpleSchema. I would like to practice my front-end development, especially CSS.</p>

<p>I've been programming for 40 years, am artistic, and can weld. I'm really good at laying out objects.</p>

<p>I work 40 hours a week, so I am free in the evenings and weekends. That is when I plan to work on the project.</p>

<div style="background-color:#F4F7F9; border-left: 2px solid cornflowerblue; padding: 1px 10px;">

<p>I'd like to work on my communication, asking the right questions and being able to explain my own ideas clearly.</p>

<p>My background is basically 4 years of programming, but most of that experience doesn't apply here. What does apply though is that if I don't know something, I'm generally good at figuring it out. I'm also detail-oriented, so I can be a second pair of eyes if something's not working.</p>

<p>My time constraints are fairly lax, I can work in the morning 3 times a week, or in the afternoon, but for the best results, I'm free in the evenings and weekends, and I plan to work at those times.</p>

<p>I am excited to work on the project in the team based environment. I would love to develop efficient communication skills.</p>

<p>My background is mostly based on web development using Django framework and tools such as Figma for web-design. All of my previous projects were solo.</p>

<p>I am working 12-20 hours a week but the schedule is flexible. I try to adjust my schedule to the time that works for the most team members.</p>

<p>I am excited to work on this project to improve my collaboration skills; I have only had one computer science group project before this.</p>

<p>My background is based on classes from the UH Mānoa BS computer science program</p>

<p>I work 30-40 hours a week Tuesdays and Thursdays are ideal. I can take off mornings before class or afternoons on Monday/Wednesday/Friday to meet. If weekends are best, I can always take off work a little early and meet in the afternoon</p>

[Link to the project's repo](https://github.com/ingeniouspartners/cabletrack.pro)

## Purpose

CableTrack PRO is the premier tool to enable electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests.

## Milestones

CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

### [M1](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/1)

In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarly the components that will be used to create the pages.

### [M2](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/2)

In Milestone 2, we will be putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This should lead to a second round of page development were we refactor code for reusability.

## Deployment

[DigitalOcean](https://app.cabletrack.pro)

## Features

#### Company Branding

CableTrack PRO allows you to brand the application with your company logo. This allows the customer to present a professional image to their clients.

#### Projects

CableTrack PRO allows you to create projects and add cables to them. You can then report progress by project.

#### Cables

CableTrack PRO allows you to create cables and add them to projects. You can then track the progress of each cable.
