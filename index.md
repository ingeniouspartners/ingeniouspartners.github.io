<p>Through this project, I would like to gain more experience on team based projects.</p>

<p>All of the programming projects I've done so far have been solo projects, so I’m excited to see the process of creating a practical application as a team. I would like to improve my knowledge on meteor and react by learning through my group members or online.</p>

<p>My background is from prior ICS classes at UH Manoa. I’d say my greatest skill is that I can spend long periods of time on something until I finish. It’s not really a skill, but I will spend as many hours needed to complete a project.</p>

<p>I would like to learn more about Meteor, React, Bootstrap, and SimpleSchema. I would like to practice my front-end development, especially CSS.</p>

<p>I've been programming for 40 years, am artistic, and can weld. I'm really good at laying out objects.</p>

<p>I'd like to work on my communication, asking the right questions and being able to explain my own ideas clearly.</p>

<p>My background is basically 4 years of programming, but most of that experience doesn't apply here. What does apply though is that if I don't know something, I'm generally good at figuring it out. I'm also detail-oriented, so I can be a second pair of eyes if something's not working.</p>

<p>I am excited to work on the project in the team based environment. I would love to develop efficient communication skills.</p>

<p>My background is mostly based on web development using Django framework and tools such as Figma for web-design. All of my previous projects were solo.</p>

[Link to the project's repo](https://github.com/ingeniouspartners/cabletrack.pro)

## Purpose

CableTrack PRO is the premier tool to enable electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests.

## Milestones

CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

### [M1](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/1)

In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarly the components that will be used to create the pages.

### [M2](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/2)

In Milestone 2, we will be putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This should lead to a second round of page development were we refactor code for reusability.

### [M3](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/3)

In Milestone 3, we will be instrumenting the code with tests and adding documentation.

## Deployment

[DigitalOcean](https://app.cabletrack.pro)
